
1. Understanding data types: integers, floats,strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries,sets.
ans. 
 1. Integers (int) - An integer is a whole number, without a fractional part.
a = 10   # an integer
b = -7   # negative integer
sum = a + b  # sum will be 3

 2. Floats (float) - A float represents a number that has a decimal point.
a = 3.14  # a float number
b = -1.5  # another float number
product = a * b  # product will be -4.71

 3. Strings (str) - A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. It represents text data.
greeting = "Hello, World!"  # a string
name = "John"
message = greeting + " " + name  # Concatenation: "Hello, World! John"

 4. Lists (list) - A list is an ordered collection of elements, which can be of any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  # a list of strings
fruits.append('orange')  # Add 'orange' to the list
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']


2. Python variables and memory allocation.
ans.
 1.variables:
In Python, variables are references to objects stored in memory. When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates the object in memory and binds the variable to it.

 2.Memory allocation:
Memory allocation is managed automatically by Python's memory manager, using techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to reclaim unused memory.


3. Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.

Arithmetic: Perform math operations (+, -, *, /, %, **, //).
Comparison: Compare values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
Logical: Combine conditions (and, or, not).
Bitwise: Operate on bits (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>).Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.
