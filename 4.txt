1. Introduction to conditionalstatements: if, else, elif.
ans.
if: Checks a condition and executes the block of code if the condition is True.
elif: Checks another condition if the previous if or elif was False. You can have multiple elif statements.
else: Executes the block of code if all the conditions above it are False.
example:
age = 25

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age >= 18 and age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")  # This will be executed because age is between 18 and 65
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")



2. Nested if-else conditions.
ans.A nested if-else statement refers to an if-else block that is placed inside another if or else block.
This allows you to make more complex decisions and handle multiple layers of conditions.
example: 
age = 20

if age >= 18:  # Outer if
    if age < 21:  # Nested if
        print("You are an adult, but not yet eligible to drink alcohol in some countries.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult and eligible to drink alcohol.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
