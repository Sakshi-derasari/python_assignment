
1. Understanding Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines.
ans. PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal 8. 
It is the style guide for Python code, providing recommendations on how to write clean, readable, and consistent Python code. 
The primary goal of PEP 8 is to ensure that Python code is easy to read and maintain, 
especially in large teams and open-source projects.

2. Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.
ans. 4 spaces per indentation level: Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code (instead of curly braces or other markers).
Inline Comments: Used to explain a line of code. Start with # .
variables,classes,constatnts - These conventions help make Python code more readable and consistent across projects.

3.Writing readable and maintainable code.
ans. 
To write readable and maintainable Python code:
Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
Write modular code that adheres to the single responsibility principle.
Follow PEP 8 guidelines for consistent formatting and style.
Add clear comments and docstrings to explain the why behind complex code.
Keep the code simple, avoiding overly clever or complex solutions.
Handle exceptions and errors appropriately.
